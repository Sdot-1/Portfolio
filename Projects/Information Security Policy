Information Security Policy: ABC Medical Company
SEC 4303-18.02.01-5B25-S1: IS Security Policy Analysis











Information Security Policy
1.1 Purpose
The purpose of this Information Security Policy is to establish a comprehensive framework to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of all information assets managed by ABC Medical Company. Given the sensitive nature of healthcare information and our legal obligations under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), this policy ensures that appropriate administrative, technical, and physical safeguards are in place to mitigate risks and prevent unauthorized access, use, or disclosure of protected health information (PHI).
This policy also aligns with recognized standards such as NIST SP 800-53 and ISO/IEC 27001 to promote best practices in healthcare cybersecurity and risk management.
1.2 Scope
This policy applies to:
•	All employees, contractors, interns, and third-party service providers who access ABC Medical Company’s information systems or data.
•	All information systems, applications, networks, hardware, and electronic media that store, transmit, or process sensitive or regulated data, including PHI and personally identifiable information (PII).
•	All physical and digital environments under the control of ABC Medical Company, including remote work and mobile device use.
This policy covers organizational and technical controls as they pertain to data governance, access control, security operations, compliance, and incident response.
1.3 Risk Statement
ABC Medical Company operates in a highly regulated environment where the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of sensitive health information are paramount. Failure to secure protected health information (PHI) and personally identifiable information (PII) can result in serious consequences, including regulatory penalties under HIPAA, reputational damage, loss of patient trust, and operational disruption due to cybersecurity incidents.
This policy is designed to mitigate the following key risks:
•	Unauthorized access to sensitive systems and data (PHI leaks or insider threats)
•	Malware infections and phishing attacks targeting employees and endpoints
•	Data loss or corruption due to insufficient backup or secure development practices
•	Compliance violations from gaps in training, policy enforcement, or documentation
•	Physical breaches resulting in stolen or damaged devices and media
•	Unsecured remote access to critical systems during telework or vendor support
2. Acceptable Use
2.1 Email Use
Email is a critical communication tool at ABC Medical Company, but it also poses risks of unauthorized data disclosure and phishing. To protect sensitive information:
•	Company email accounts must be used for all work-related communications; personal accounts are prohibited.
•	Transmission of PHI via email is only permitted when the email is encrypted or sent through a secure messaging platform.
•	All emails are scanned for malware, phishing, and spam using advanced email security gateways.
•	Employees must report suspicious emails immediately to the IT or security team.
•	Auto-forwarding of company emails to external accounts is not allowed.
•	Training on email security awareness, including phishing simulations, is provided at least annually.
